## Notes the Aider Architect gave on Nov 27, 2024

Prompt: /architect take aa look at the things in /notes and give me your thoughts on the architecture described.  does it make sense?  where are there missing parts?  what is good about this framework and what is questionable?  what else would you add?


After reviewing the notes, here's my analysis of the architecture:

Strengths:
1. The "baked" architecture using SQLite is clever and unique:
   - Packaging all content, templates, and assets into a single SQLite database is elegant
   - Using AbsurdSQL for client-side SQLite enables true offline functionality
   - Pre-rendering for initial fast loads while maintaining dynamic capabilities is smart

2. Progressive Enhancement Approach:
   - Static HTML first for SEO and initial load
   - Enhanced with client-side capabilities after load
   - Offline-first design with service worker backup

3. Simple but Flexible Template System:
   - Pure JavaScript/HTML/CSS approach keeps it lightweight
   - Template inheritance is implemented cleanly
   - Component system allows for extensibility

Missing/Unclear Parts:

1. Data Management:
   - How to handle large media files (videos, high-res images)
   - No clear strategy for database size limits in browsers
   - Need clearer incremental update mechanism for the SQLite database

2. Build Process:
   - Need more detail on optimization of assets during build
   - Image processing pipeline isn't fully specified
   - No clear cache invalidation strategy

3. Development Experience:
   - No hot reload/development server specified
   - Missing clear debugging tools/strategies
   - No mention of content preview system

Suggestions to Add:

1. Content Management:
   - Add a simple CMS interface for content editors
   - Include draft/preview system
   - Add version control for content

2. Performance:
   - Add lazy loading strategy for images/heavy content
   - Include partial database loading for large sites
   - Add asset optimization pipeline

3. Developer Tools:
   - Add development server with hot reload
   - Include debugging tools for template rendering
   - Add content validation system

4. Features:
   - Add search functionality using SQLite FTS
   - Include analytics capability
   - Add multi-language support
   - Add theme system

Questionable Aspects:

1. Database Size:
   - Loading entire site into browser might be problematic for large sites
   - Need clear strategy for handling growing content

2. Browser Support:
   - AbsurdSQL compatibility might limit browser support
   - Need fallback strategies for unsupported browsers

3. Build Complexity:
   - The build process might become complex with all assets in SQLite
   - Need to ensure build times stay reasonable
